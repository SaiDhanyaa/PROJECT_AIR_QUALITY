# Forecasting Carbon Dioxide Emission level
## Project Overview:
**Designed a Forecasting model which forecasts CO2 emission levels, taking number of years you want to forecast as input.
Analyzed time series for stationary and used different transformation.
Implemented different forecasting model like ARIMA, Smoothing techniques like Holt - winter's method etc.
Compared different model based on MAPE value which were built both on stationary and non - stationary data.
Deployed model using Streamlit.
