# Forecasting Carbon Dioxide Emission level
## Project Overview:
* Designed a Forecasting model which forecasts CO2 emission levels, taking number of years you want to forecast as input.
* Analyzed time series for stationary and used different transformation.
* Implemented different forecasting model like ARIMA, Smoothing techniques like Holt - winter's method etc.
* Compared different model based on MAPE value which were built both on stationary and non - stationary data.
* Deployed model using Streamlit.
* Please visit the PPT provided in this repository for in-depth understanding.
## How to run ?
* Download this project folder.
* Open Anaconda prompt in root project directory and run this command: streamlit run TS.py
* After opening of browser, Upload CO2_dataset.csv provided in the folder.
* Enter the number of years you want to forecast and press enter.
